This example generates a Ta SNAP potential (Ta_JCP2014) using the training set in the
JSON folder.

To run it:

1. Build a LAMMPS executable with the SNAP package installed
2. Edit the following settings in TaJCP2014_SNAP.in
to match your local platform:

   lammpsPath     # The location of the LAMMPS executable
   mpiLauncher    # The MPI run command
   maxConcurrency # Cap the number of MPI processes used to run LAMMPS.

3. Run fitsnap.py:

../../src/fitsnap.py < TaJCP2014_SNAP.in > fitsnap.log

The following files will be created:

    Data/
    DumpSnap/
    grouplist.out
    Ta.snapcoeff
    Ta.snapparam
    pot_TaJCP2014.mod
    SNAPenergy_MeanError.dat
    SNAPforce_MeanError.dat
    SNAPvirial_MeanError.dat

These should be similar to the versions provided in directory StandardFitResults_xxMonthYear.

To run the potential in LAMMPS, copy these files:

   Ta.snapcoeff
   Ta.snapparam
   pot_Ta.mod

to the working directory and put:

   include pot_TaJCP2014.mod

in the LAMMPS input script.

See /docs/Literature/1-s2.0-S0021999114008353-main.pdf for more details about this potential and training data included.
